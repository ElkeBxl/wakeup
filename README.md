# wakeup

A simple Ionic 3 app that vibrates, if you enter the geofence.

# Requirements
To set up NodeJS : https://nodejs.org/en/
To set up Ionic: https://ionicframework.com/getting-started

After cloning the repo, issue the following commands in terminal
```
  >> cd wakeup
  >> ionic serve
```
The 'serve' command will ask your permission to install project dependencies, proceed with Yes. When it completes, your default browser will open with the app's home page. 

Voila ! You got it running :) Congrats
